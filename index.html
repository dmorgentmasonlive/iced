<h2>Don't Break the Ice!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're skating on thin ice. Don't break it!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel a sense of tension as the ice begins to crack and break away limiting thier options for victory.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a two-player real-time strategy game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players move on the ice using the arrow keys and WASD. The ice is slippery, so once you start moving you can't stop. Every second the ice will begin to break under the players' weights. The goal is to not be the one who breaks the ice. Players can collide with each other temporily changing each players' momentum. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is testing ice physics and platforms that break away over time based on player location.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Ice Physics: One you start moving you'll continue to slide around.
Two-Player Gameplay: This is a zero-sum game. One will win; one will lose.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set on a thin platform of ice. The player tokens are abstract representations of a hero and villain.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Two players are stranded on a glacier of thin ice. The ice is thick enough to hold one person, but not two. Neither player wants to drown, so they are moving around the glacier to try not to break the ice.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is appropriate for all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
A single game takes one to two minutes. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is a sound that will play when the ice is just about to break. If you move off a platform that is about to break at that exact moment, you can break the ice without drowning.
</li>
